# Tank vs. spiders
A simple game build using pygame.

## Running the application

1. Clone the repo.
2. Go to the app directory where `tank.py` is located.
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the game `python tank.py`
5. Try to survive as long as you can.

### NB!
There is no animation when the spider hits the tank (i. e. when you lose a life) so keep a track of your lives count.
